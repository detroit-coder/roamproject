                                    I love showtunes and Lions football.  I spend my free time chasing two dogs, one cat, one rabbit, a worm farm and one precocious 7 year old.

                                  Hi, I'm Liz. Nice to meet you. I am a fine-artist, designer, developer, and a Detroiter. I have a passion for coding and quality turkey sandwiches. I enjoy engineering creative solutions through design and I thrive to create a memorable and interactive user experience.

                                Hi, I’m Troy! I’m married with twins; not married to twins, and I enjoy family life to the extreme: trying everything, learn something, stop for nothing. I learned that to be successful, you have to learn how to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Completing this coding bootcamp put me through all of these situations and in the end I’m a front-end developer.
